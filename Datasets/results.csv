77,Legislators,"Associate Director, Campaigns & Public Mobilization","Background: Over the past 80 years, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has developed unparalleled expertise in responding to emergencies and helping uprooted communities rebuild. Founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein, the IRC offers lifesaving care and life-changing assistance to refugees forced to flee from war or disaster. The IRC is on the ground in more than 40 countries, providing emergency relief, relocating refugees and rebuilding lives in the wake of disaster. Through 28 offices in cities across the United States, the IRC also helps refugees and other immigrants resettle in the U.S. and become self-sufficient. The IRC is committed to a culture of bold leadership, innovation in all aspects of our work, creative partnerships and, most crucially, accountability to those we serve. The IRC is a tireless advocate for the most vulnerable. The Global Policy & Advocacy Department (P&A) is a dynamic team whose mission is to use the IRC’s field knowledge, role as expert witness, evidence and solutions to shift the agenda and decisions of policy makers for the benefit of our clients. The P&A team seeks to develop the IRC as a thought leader, and drive transformational change in the humanitarian sector. Specifically, we work to achieve improvements in aid effectiveness through evidence-based solutions; speak out on challenges facing the people we seek to assist; and to promote solutions for protracted displacement. Job Overview : Worldwide, over 65 million people are fleeing conflict and crisis, including 22.5 million refugees. Yet in the last year alone, there has been a 60% decline in global resettlement slots offered to refugees. In an astounding break from historic norms, the U.S. is on track to resettle fewer than 22,000 in FY18. At the same time, the U.S. is rapidly reversing protections for asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants, including children and families fleeing violence in Central America. The dramatic drop in refugee admissions and attacks on protection safeguards pose existential threats to lifesaving protection pathways for some of the world’s most vulnerable and to a resettlement program that has been a global gold standard. All other resettlement states combined cannot compensate for a plummet in the historic admissions record of the U.S. On the contrary, the American retreat from resettlement and asylum safeguards has weakened the resolve of other states to admit refugees and asylum seekers themselves. The domino effect extends to low- and middle-income host governments who host the vast majority of refugees, now questioning their humanitarian obligations as wealthy nations renege on theirs. After decades of leading globally in resettlement and humanitarian diplomacy, the U.S. is now leading the global retreat. Over the last two years, in response to a shifting public narrative and policy approach to resettlement and asylum safeguards and threats at both federal and state levels, the IRC has been implementing major strategic shifts in our advocacy to build up a sustained constituency for refugees and asylum protections through strengthened grassroots advocacy and public mobilization, alongside our deep history of engagement with policymakers in the executive and legislative branches. The Associate Director for Campaigns and Public Mobilization will lead the IRC’s public mobilization activities aimed at building a public constituency for refugees, growing IRC’s public influence around the defense of the refugee resettlement program, and bolstering IRC’s public engagement and support. Major Responsibilities: Lead the development and implementation of an ambitious and multi-faceted public mobilization strategy, including guiding strategic and thematic direction, leading internal collaboration across public-facing IRC teams, managing technical staff, and collaborating with Policy and Advocacy colleagues leading federal congressional, state legislative, and state/local advocacy initiatives in the US on campaigns Oversee digital campaign activations: Develop online targets and tactics in close collaboration with internal stakeholders (Communications, USP & Marketing teams), shape messaging and content, and coordinate technical execution of petitions, emails, text messaging, letter-writing, 3rd party acquisitions, paid and organic promotion and legislator call-in opportunities In collaboration with the Communications team, develop and support delivery of disruptive stunts or communications events intended to galvanize attention and public support for our issues Support development and implementation, together with Policy and Advocacy colleagues, a strategy to mobilize key influencers including grasstops at national and local levels aimed at influencing federal policy Lead IRC Advocacy strategy and engagement with the We Are All America campaign, and collaborate with other coalition partners as appropriate Contribute to the development of an integrated campaigns calendar shared by the Policy and Advocacy team and other public-facing IRC teams, including USP, Communications and Marketing Represent the Policy and Advocacy team in relevant cross-departmental governance bodies or working groups on the IRC’s public engagement strategy Key Working Relationships: Position reports to: Senior Director, U.S. Refugee Resettlement and Protection Advocacy Position directly supervises: Digital Advocacy Content Manager Internal contacts: Global Policy and Advocacy team; US Programs HQ, Executive Directors and field staff; HQ Communications team; Revenue team (Institutional Philanthropy and Partnerships; Marketing) External contacts: Relevant coalition partners (such as We Are All America, other US immigration and refugee grassroots coalitions) Job Requirements: _Education:_ Advanced degree in a relevant field preferred.
